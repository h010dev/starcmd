# About The Project

STARCMD is a personal desktop application aimed at helping developers and alike to store hard to remember commands. Users can add additional information such as examples, references, and documentation to aid in understanding the command at a later date. The goal is to reduce the need to create complex aliases or bookmark StackOverflow pages just to be able to revisit them again at a later date. 

This project is being actively worked on, so stay tuned for more updates!

### Built With
* GTK+ 3.0
* Glade
* C

# Getting Started

At its current state, you will have to compile the application locally to get it up and running. I've only tested this on Linux platforms (namely Ubuntu 20.0.4 LTS), but plan on expanding testing and coverage once the current iteration of the app is completed. 

The application has a few dependencies, those being:
* cesanta-mongoose
* cURL
* OpenSSL
* sqlite3

These are the steps I followed to get my environment set up on a fresh Ubuntu 20.04 LTS VM instance:

(I'll be updating this part soon)
